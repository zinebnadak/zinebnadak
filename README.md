## Hello, I'm Zineb 👋

I’m a first-year student and solopreneur focusing on learning by building.

Right now I’m working on:
♡ Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL)
♡ Building small systems that automate repetitive workflows
♡ Exploring practical uses of AI (LLMs, APIs, basic integrations)
♡ Learning how to design simple, reliable automations end-to-end
♡ Git, GitHub, and clean development workflows

### What I’m interested in
♡ Writing clean, understandable code
♡ AI automation & workflow integration
♡ Chatbots (LLM-based)
♡ APIs (REST, custom integrations)

### Current goals
♡ Ship small, complete projects in days, not months
♡ Prioritize simplicity and correctness over overengineering
♡ Learn how real-world codebases are structured and maintained
♡ Become comfortable reading and understanding unfamiliar code
♡ Contribute to open source once I can add meaningful value

### Tech I’m learning
♡ Workflow automation
♡ APIs
♡ Git & GitHub
