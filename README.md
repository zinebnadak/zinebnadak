## Hello, I'm Zineb 👋

I’m a first-year student and solopreneur focusing on learning by building.

Right now I’m working on:
- Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL)
- Building small systems that automate repetitive workflows
- Exploring practical uses of AI (LLMs, APIs, basic integrations)
- Learning how to design simple, reliable automations end-to-end
- Git, GitHub, and clean development workflows

### What I’m interested in
- Writing clean, understandable code
- AI automation & workflow integration
- Chatbots (LLM-based)
- APIs (REST, custom integrations)

### Current goals
- Ship small, complete projects in days, not months
- Prioritize simplicity and correctness over overengineering
- Learn how real-world codebases are structured and maintained
- Become comfortable reading and understanding unfamiliar code
- Contribute to open source once I can add meaningful value

### Tech I’m learning
- Workflow automation
- APIs
- Git & GitHub
